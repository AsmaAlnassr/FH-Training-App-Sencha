# FeedHenry Sencha Tutorial - v9

## Overview

In this version of the tutorial we will restructure the app appearance. Instead of using icons to access differernt features of the app we will use a Tab Panel. This is similar to the structure found in most apps. This would usually be a difficult task but with Sencha it is easy. t the end of this tutorial you will know how to;

* Create an App that uses a tab panel view.
* Add items to a tab panel.
* Handle orientation changes within an app.
